Exercise 01: Towards a more useful
fixed-point number class
Exercise 01
Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
Turn-in directory : ex01/
Files to turn in : Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
Allowed functions : roundf (from <cmath>)
The previous exercise was a good start but our class is pretty useless. It can only
represent the value 0.0.
Add the following public constructors and public member functions to your class:
• A constructor that takes a constant integer as a parameter.
It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value is
initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.
• A constructor that takes a constant floating-point number as a parameter.
It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value is
initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.
• A member function float toFloat( void ) const;
that converts the fixed-point value to a floating-point value.
• A member function int toInt( void ) const;
that converts the fixed-point value to an integer value.
And add the following function to the Fixed class files:
• An overload of the insertion («) operator that inserts a floating-point representation
of the fixed-point number into the output stream object passed as parameter.
Running this code:
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
Fixed a;
Fixed const b( 10 );
Fixed const c( 42.42f );
Fixed const d( b );
a = Fixed( 1234.4321f );
std::cout << "a is " << a << std::endl;
std::cout << "b is " << b << std::endl;
std::cout << "c is " << c << std::endl;
std::cout << "d is " << d << std::endl;
std::cout << "a is " << a.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "b is " << b.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "c is " << c.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "d is " << d.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
return 0;
}
Should output something similar to:
